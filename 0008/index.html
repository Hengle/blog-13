    <p>
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/evpvp/">MikuMikuDance</a> (MMD) is a free 3D animation software that is very popular in Japan.
        Ever since the software was first revealed 11 years ago, it has gained a large and strong user base. It simple user interface allowed
        amateurs to quickly pick up 3D animation. It has inspired modelers to create thousands of models of anime-style characters, animators
        to generate hundreds of elaborate dance motions, and video creators to upload hundreds of thousands of 3D animations made using the
        software to the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
        While MMD has made great impact to the Japanese 3D animation community, its closed-source nature seems to limit the usefulness
        of the software itself and its associated data, especially to a programmer: it is hard to develop tools that work with MMD data
        if we don't know how exactly the software works. This is not to say that there's a lack of tools to manipulate the data. 
        There are MMD-compatible close-sourced danimation authoring tools such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mikumikumoving/">MikuMikuMoving</a>
        and <a href="https://nanoem.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/">nanoem</a>. There are also open source viewers and libraries such as
        <a href="https://github.com/newpolaris/Mikudayo">Mikudayo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benikabocha/saba">saba</a>, 
    </p>

    <p>
        As a programmer who is fascinated by the available MMD data, I have been struggling for a long time to develop tools to use them.
        Recently, I felt that I have succeeded in producing animatated mesh that are close to the MMD's output. As a result, I would like
        to share the algorithm that I used so that other people might be able to do the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        This article documents how to compute the mesh of an MMD character, specified mainly under the PMX format, under the motion or pose
        specified in VMD or VPD formats, respectively.
